2650,"At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges. On the one hand, the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand. Self drive travel organizers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with meager profits. On the other hand, self drive travel ae confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages.",但与此同时，有望突破万亿规模的自驾游市场却也面临着双重挑战，一方面自驾游产业的发展与市场需求不成正比，自驾游俱乐部以及旅行社等自驾游组织者面临着盈利微薄的困境；另一方面，自驾游所面对的基础设施和服务也还处于初级阶段。
2651,"Accounting for 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism, with market size expected to exceed RMB1 trillion",占国内游总人次60％，市场规模有望破万亿
2655,"In July 2017, eight government agencies including the China National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports jointly issued the “Plans for the Development of Automobile Campsites for Self Drive Sports”.

2671,"The design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but adhering to the design concept of “experience the joy of driving” so as to provide self drive travelers the best enjoyment of beautiful scenery along the route. Scenic routes are able to connect spots and facets of the travel landscape. These would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route. Meanwhile, various thematic activities may also be held to enhance tourist participation and recreation experience, creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry.",风景道设计不再是出发地到目的地之间最直接快捷的路径，而是遵从“体验驾车乐趣”的设计理念，为自驾游客提供欣赏沿路美景的最佳享受；风景道能够将点状、面状旅游景观相联结，既保留了沿线生态旅游资源的历史价值和文化价值，也能举办各类主题性活动增强游客的参与性与游憩体验，为当地旅游业创造经济效益。
2676,Consumer groups,消费群
2681,"Meanwhile, with higher consumption demand, tourists who enjoyed self drive “tour of sights” have begun to change their opinion. Instead of “alighting to take photos, and boarding to sleep” during the self drive travel process, they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process.",同时随着消费需求的提升，过去喜欢自驾“游览景点”的游客开始转变观念，不再是自驾游过程中“下车拍照、上车睡觉”，而是更加关注旅行的体验和过程。

3697,"With the recent announcement of the construction of new types of frigates by major naval powers in the world, it seems that frigates have become the focus of attention of the major naval powers overnight. First, Japan has decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 annual defense budget, finally making a substantial breakthrough for its DEX frigates program. Later, Lockheed Martin of USA recently published the latest arrangement for the United States FFG frigates program. How about China's plan for building new type of frigates?",随着近期世界各大海军强国先后公布了新型护卫舰的建造计划，仿佛一夜之间护卫舰有成了各大强国海军关注的焦点，先是日本在2018年度防卫预算中确定采购两艘新型护卫舰，使得日本DEX护卫舰计划终于有了实质性的突破，后是美国洛克希德马丁于近期公布了美国FFG护卫舰计划的最新方案，那么中国的新型护卫舰该何去何从呢？
3698,"With the launching of the latest model of 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the number of 054A frigate has reached 29, approaching the sum of the 053H series frigates. Since the first 054A was launched in 2006, the history of building 054A has extended to 12 years. Building such a large number of high-performance general purpose frigates is very rare in the history. Apart from China, the only comparable accomplishment was made by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s when it built a host of 'Perry' class frigates.",随着2017年末一艘最新的054A型护卫舰的下水，标志着054A护卫舰已经建造了高达29艘之多，已经逼近了053H系列护卫舰的总和，而从2006年第一艘054A下水至今，054A的建造历程已经有了12年之久，即使在全世界范围内，建造如此数量之多的高性能通用护卫舰，除了中国，也只有美国在上个世纪7、80年代建造的“佩里”级护卫舰可以相提并论了。
3707,"First, the displacement will be increased significantly compared to the current 054A model. It is estimated that the displacement of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons. The ship will be equipped with a comprehensive electric propulsion system that combines a QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, improving the maximum speed to around 30 knots and significantly increase the cruise range. As for the weaponry, the 76mm main gun and 1130 near-range anti-aircraft gun will be retained, but a HQ-10 launch system will be added. A shared vertical launching system for 32-48 unit HQ-16 modified missile and Fish-8 missiles will be furnished at the back of the main gun. A large 8-16-unit vertical launching system should be furnished at the middle-to-rear section of the hull for the launch of YJ-18 and new cruise missiles. Hangars and parking platforms will also be expanded for the parking and storage of two 10-ton helicopters. As for the electronic radar systems, the high grade model will be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase-control array radar developed based on 346A. the low grade model will be furnished with multi-function rotating phased array radar similar to the ones on European frigates.",首先来说排水量相对于现在的054A型护卫舰将有一个大幅度的增加，估计新型护卫舰的排水量会达到5000-6000吨左右;动力系统将会采用有一台QC280改进型燃气轮机和两台柴油机组成的综合电力推进系统，最高航速有望达到30节左右，续航力也会大幅度增加;至于武器配置76毫米主炮和1130近防炮应该会保留，但是会增加一座红旗10发射系统，主炮后面应该会有一个32-48单元红旗16改进型和鱼-8共架的垂发系统，在舰体中后方应该会加装一个8-16单元的大型垂发系统用于发射鹰击18和新型巡航导弹;机库和停机平台也会增大，达到两架10吨级直升机的停放和存放;至于电子雷达系统方面，高配的话应该会装备基于346A发展的小型四面固定相控阵雷达，低配的话可以使用类似于欧洲护卫舰上的多功能旋转相控阵雷达。

3727,"Today, let's discuss the question more serious than buying a house: repay the loan.",今天，我们就来聊聊比买房更为严峻的问题：还贷。
3728,I. China's growing housing debt crisis,一、中国日益严重的房债危机
3729,"The People's Daily Overseas Edition published a commentary titled “Awards and Loans: The Joy and Worries of Struggling Young People” on January 17th. The article cited some data from an report on the progress of nationwide financial deleveraging in the 3rth quarter jointly published by the National Laboratory of Finance and Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center in November 2017. According to the report, the leverage ratio of the residents' sector continues to climb, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3%, which amounts to an increase of 3.8% in the first three quarters of 2017.",《人民日报》海外版于1月17日发表了评论文章《奖与贷︰奋斗青年的乐与忧》，根据文中的数据显示，2017年11月，中国社科院国家金融与发展实验室、国家资产负债表研究中心发布的《三季度中国去杠杆进程报告》指出，居民部门杠杆率依然延续上升趋势，从2017年二季度的47.4%上升到三季度的48.6%，上升了1.3个百分点，2017年前三个季度上升了3.8个百分点。
3734,"Seeing such data, one cannot help but be stupefied. According to the statistical data of Suning Financial Research Institute, the leverage ratio of Chinese households was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008. But this figure doubled in just six years since the trend of rapid growth of leverage ratio set in, reaching 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage ratio of households has reached 48.6%.",看到这样的数据，让人不禁有些瞠目结舌，根据苏宁金融研究院的统计数据显示，1996年中国居民杠杆率只有3%，2008年也仅为18%，但是自2008年以来居民杠杆率开始呈现迅速增长态势，短短六年间翻了一倍，达到36.4%。到了2017年三季度居民杠杆率已经高达48.6%。
3737,"The report pointed out that China's young people who were born in 1980s and 1990s have a home ownership rate of 70%, far ahead of Mexico at the second place (46%), and twice the US level (35%).",报告指出，中国的80、90后年轻人住房拥有率高达70%，遥遥领先第二名墨西哥（46%），也是美国该项指标（35%）的2倍水平。
3749,"The problem did not stop there. As house prices continue to fall, a new situation emerged: The money the bank got after auctioning the defaulted house was less than the loan the home buyer owed the bank, the home buyer still need to repay the loan. So stopping repayment does not necessarily mean that you are cleaned of the debt. For example, if you paid a down payment of $600,000 and borrowed $2.4 million to buy a house worth $3 million at the time. When the house price falls to $2 million, you stop to repay the loan and give the house to the bank. After the bank auctions the house, you will not only lost your down payment of $600,000, but also owed $400,000 debts to the bank. You still have to repay the debt.",而问题不止如此，因为房价的持续下跌，大家停止还贷把房子给银行之后并不是你就没有债务了，如果银行拍卖房子得到的钱还还不上你欠银行的贷款的话，那么你还是需要接着还钱，简单点说假设你用首付60万，贷款240万买了一套当时价值300万的房子，当房价下跌到这个房子只值200万的时候，你不再还贷把房子给了银行，银行拍卖房子之后，你不仅损失了自己的首付60万，还倒欠银行40万的债务，你还是要接着还钱。
